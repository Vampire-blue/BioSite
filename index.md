## Welcome to the ShitShow!

Welcome! If you are here you must be intrested in my implants, 
or you just scanned my hand and now you are here not by choice... Either way, Welcome!
<br/><br/>
My Name is Blue, I am a 19 year old australian biohacker and game development student.

### What is a biohacker?

There is alot of definitions of a biohacker/Biohacking but the dictionary states biohacking as:
```markdown
bio·hack·ing | ˈbī-ō-ˌha-kiŋ 
biological experimentation (as by gene editing or the use of drugs or implants) 
done to improve the qualities or capabilities of living organisms especially 
by individuals and groups working outside a traditional medical or scientific research environment
```

Now you can see it mentions Genes Drugs and implants, I am on the implant side. I do belive in domestic bettering of the human race without the help of more traditional means. "Avoiding the red tape" if you will. But that dosn't mean i do not belive in traditional medicine, there are some "biohackers" that work entirly in diets and other sudo science that i am very sceptical of. I am what they call a grinder, a biohacking Sub-Genre that works mostly in electronics and implants.


## My Implants

### The NExT

 * Implanted on: 24/12/19
 * Implanted By: [Piercing HQ Melbourne](https://www.piercinghq.com.au/)
   * Peircer: Paulus Van Nes
 * Location: L1 Hand
   * (Aka Between Left Thumb and pointer finger)
 * Use: Due to the NExT being a dual chip i use:
   * Rfid Side: Unlock My pc,Cupoard door and work door
   * Nfc Side: This website and sometimes [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&list=PLahKLy8pQdCM0SiXNn3EfGIXX19QGzUG3)
 * Fun Fact: This implant is a dual chip, half Nfc and half Rfid. This allows me to use my chip in multiple use cases and saves space in my hand (2 for 1!)

### The Magic Flex **(Custom)**
 * Implanted on: ***Yet To Be Implanted***
 * Implanted By: [Piercing HQ Melbourne](https://www.piercinghq.com.au/)
   * Peircer: Paulus Van Nes
 * Location: Ontop of Left Hand
 * Use: This implant will be able to open my doors at school
   * Also Just for show due to the LEDs
 * Fun Fact: This is a custom implant, Dangerous things makes 2 diffrent flex implants that include LED "Blinkies" The [FlexMT](https://dangerousthings.com/product/flexmt/) and The [FlexNExT](https://dangerousthings.com/product/flexnext/). I didn't need to get somthing like the FlexNExT because i allredy have the capsule version, but the FlexMT only fits 2 LEDs unlike the 3 in the FlexNExT. This was an issue as i would be forever annoyed at the asymmetry of 2 LEDs vs 3. So i was able to get a custom FlexMT without the T5577 chip, giving the implat space to add a third LED "Blinkie". Due to it not being an MT anymore you would think i would call it a FlexM1 (M1 meaning magic 1k (The chip type)) but the FlexM1 is allredy a diffrent implant alltogether, so the Magic Flex was born!
