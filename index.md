## Welcome to the ShitShow!

Welcome! If you are here you must be intrested in my implants, 
or you just scanned my hand and now you are here not by choice... Either way, Welcome!
<br/><br/>
My Name is Blue, I am a 19 year old australian biohacker and game development student.

### What is a biohacker?

There is alot of definitions of a biohacker/Biohacking but the dictionary states biohacking as:
```markdown
bio·hack·ing | ˈbī-ō-ˌha-kiŋ 
biological experimentation (as by gene editing or the use of drugs or implants) 
done to improve the qualities or capabilities of living organisms especially 
by individuals and groups working outside a traditional medical or scientific research environment
```

Now you can see it mentions Genes Drugs and implants, I am on the implant side. I do belive in domestic bettering of the human race without the help of more traditional means. "Avoiding the red tape" if you will. But that dosn't mean i do not belive in traditional medicine, there are some "biohackers" that work entirly in diets and other sudo science that i am very sceptical of. I am what they call a grinder, a biohacking Sub-Genre that works mostly in electronics and implants.
